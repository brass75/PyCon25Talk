# PyCon US 2025 Maintainers Summit Talk

At the PyCon US 2025 Maintainers summit I gave a talk on writing security advisories. This repo has that presentation in both Keynote and PDF.

Please note that the PDF might not match the Keynote until the talk is done. It all depends on how much editing I do.
